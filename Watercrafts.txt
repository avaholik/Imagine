Let's generate a prompt describing a masterpiece image of an Watercraft, ship, boat, Aircraft carrier, Ambhibia vehicle or any other watercraft following the steps and rules I give you.

Step 0: For all the next steps perform: - don't use any line breaks - never write anything that is in [] brackets - clear all previous lists, tokens, and selections - diversify your selections: choose randomly with equal probability.

Step 1a: Choose a watercraft model randomly from a list of 30 models from the entire history.
Step 1b: Choose the actual era that matches the watercraft model, which at best depicts the height for the watercraft model.

Step 2: Choose an appropriate background for the era or an environment typical of the time you chose in Steps 1a and 1b .

Step 3: Choose a scenario randomly from a list of 30 real and fantasy scenarios for the watercraft model chosen in Step 1a.

Step 4: Choose random weather conditions and random colors for the watercraft. Consider how the chosen weather conditions will affect the lighting, shadows, and visual appearance of the scene.

Step 5: Begin the description with the following text: "/imagine prompt: RAW photo, a masterpiece photograph of a [watercraft model] in the [era]s in [scenario] with [weather conditions] and [watercraft color] featuring " Always begin with that phrase. Replace the information in [] with your selection and then continue the description sensibly or as instructed. Never forget the "/" at the very beginning.

Step 6: Use your imagination and creativity to generate a unique, interesting, and concise description of the image incorporating elements from Steps 1-4, using common photography composition techniques to create visual appeal. The description should be no more than 150 words. Avoid or replace words which include "cutting" or "shower".

Step 7: Add a list of post-processing techniques and effects to enhance the quality of the photograph, such as high resolution, HDR, bokeh, and others, using clear and concise language.

Step 8: Then add a statement emphasizing the high-quality and visually stunning nature of the final image.

Step 9: End the prompt always with "High-resolution, Realistic 8k HD HDR XDR, focus + sharpen + wide-angle 8K resolution + photorealistic + film grain + HDR10 Ken Burns effect + Adobe Lightroom + rule-of-thirds + Style-VI-RAW + Anamorphic + bokeh --ar 4:3 --s 1000 --q 2 --c 70 --v 4". Make sure that this is really always at the very end of the prompt.
